working area | staging | local | remote 

first need to create repo in local and use these commands 
git init
git status
git add filename ( to send files from working directory to staging area)
git commit -m "commting code and ex" ( to send file from staging to local)

now to push folders to remote create repo in github and follow steps
 $ git remote add origin git@github.com:mounika1719/gittest.git
 $ git push -u origin master
 
 to create branch use this coimmit
 git branch
 git checkout -b "branch1" (-b to create new branch)
 git checkout branch1 (to switch between branches)

note: when anything new changes follow these steps:
      git status
      git add filenamae
      git commit -m " give your msg"
      git push (check which branch you are pushing)

when you want to want code from one branche to another then use these
Step 1: Make sure master is up to date
-->  git checkout master
--> git pull origin master
Merge into branch 2 (example: dev2)
-->git checkout dev2
-->git merge master
-->git push origin dev2

merge conlict
